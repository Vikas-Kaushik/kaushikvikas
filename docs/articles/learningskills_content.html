<h3>The tough part of being a subject expert - Learning</h3>

<p>On the road to be an expert on any subject, we have two kind of learnings involved, learn by heart and learn by brain. Learning by brain is understanding logics behind, it&rsquo;s interesting most of the times. Learning by heart is like cramming terminologies and meanings associated with them, practicing to get hands on, I call it the hard part because it&rsquo;s not as interesting as its counterpart in fact it&rsquo;s boring most of the times.</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing this to clarify the fundamental illusions between what to do or what not to, when it comes to the hard part. If you fail to cram or to understand, you fail to be the subject specialist. About understanding things, only way out is spend more time with basics. About cramming things, only way out is &ldquo;Hard-Work&rdquo;. You have to be stubborn with that, you do it until you learn it by heart, do it whatever number of times it takes, just keep doing it.</p>

<p>We feel that our brain powers are limited, causing not deep linked conclusions. By deep linked conclusions I mean you are not making any assumptions on the way. At some level we all have to rely on abstraction. So called more intelligent people can go deeper, but they also got limits. And the conclusion they arrive on based on their understandings are not certified up to the roots. They are proven to be true up to a certain depth of thinking not beyond. That&#39;s why theories bend and change, when someone shakes the basics beneath the abstraction that we used to make theories or conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a part of evolution. Theories and concepts are growing larger than our thinking hardware. Evolution forces us to evolve to comply with new requirements i.e. need for more brain, seems true as next generation people are visibly more intelligent, every parent knows it. Also one thing, just talking about complex theories and formulas, don&#39;t make us intelligent, we are very much a part of the average generation. Those are the real gods who invent and derive what we rely on, that&rsquo;s very level of specialist category if I&#39;m not exaggerating it.</p>

<h3>Learning ethics vs Business</h3>

<p>Business have always bothered me as it&rsquo;s all about making more money and being in demand always, these are priorities for business. Other so called positive sides of it are agility and innovation due to competition in the market, caring about society and environment etc. But priority is priority, when it comes to choose between goodwill and money, a businessman choose to be more practical and that&rsquo;s MONEY always.</p>

<p>There are two lines, monetary system and the ethical system. Think yourself, what if you just got a life changing idea or some way out of a big global issue or just invented something. Are you going to disclose it to the people in the goodwill so that enhancements can be made, to be utilized by people in need, and open the idea so that it can be modified or aligned with other ideas for the greater good? What&#39;ll you do?&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here you&#39;ll feel like you are paying cost of being good. Instead of selling your idea, converting the spent brain energy in to physical worth. In a society &quot;being good&quot; should be rewarding or at least free, business will never allow that.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Can&rsquo;t focus &ndash; can&rsquo;t learn?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If you are facing problem in learning or not able to read books calmly, dude you are in some serious problem. Nothing big can be achieved without patience and focus. You may be the victim of fast forward life style or sci-fi movies causing less practical thoughts in you.</p>

<p>Following might be the reasons your focus is behaving like a butterfly:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. to focus on one task - your brain should find it important or interesting or both. You may not be feeling the task in hand as important or interesting.</p>

<p>2. You may be thinking that you can do multitasking and develop a super computer like brain. Please have a look on this article: Why Multitasking Doesn&#39;t Work http://www.forbes.com/sites/douglasmerrill/2012/08/17/why-multitasking-doesnt-work/</p>

<p>Multitasking people have more trouble tuning out distractions than people who focus on one task at a time. Also, doing so many different things at once can actually impair cognitive ability.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>

<p>There&#39;s too much information coming out of every direction, pity on our brains, it can&#39;t take up so much. Learning and remembering are very precious functionalities of brain, it takes their own time, don&#39;t try to be over smart to rapid up these two processes, since you can&#39;t. It&#39;s natural.</p>

Find a peer group, discussion is the best way to develop interest in any topic.</span>&nbsp;</p>
