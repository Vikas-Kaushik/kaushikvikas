<p>Google defines abstraction as:
	<blockquote><ul>
		<li><em>“The quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.”</em></li>
		<li><em>“Freedom from representational qualities in art.”</em></li>
		<li>or simply – <em>“Hiding details and showing only useful stuff.”</em></li>
	</ul></blockquote>

Skill to use power of abstraction is very helpful in programming subject and personal life as well. Everyone uses abstraction at some level to learn more. We have an assumption and on the basis of faith in that assumption we start learning further. Skill to look at a problem from different levels of abstraction is must for a designer. Handling abstraction is an art that comes with practice and experience.</p>

<p><h3>Abstraction for API/UI Design</h3>Abstraction is more than hiding details from user. It is the way you manage user’s freedom to customize or access facilities. Library/API or you can say an interface is a conceptualisation of abstraction. If you give more freedom or facilities to its user, it ends up in too many options for user making a more customizable but complex system, it’s not a good design. If you have restricted user too much by providing very less facilities, you are limiting the ways your interface may be used, it’s not a good design as well. A good design is a perfect blend of ease of use, power and flexibility.</p>

<p><h3>Flexibility(Power) vs Simplicity(ease of use)</h3>
Flexibility and simplicity (ease of use) pull each other in opposite directions. Exactly like generalisation and specialisation. One give you freedom of use, power of customization and space for creativity but it’s not free. It comes with investment of hard work and time involved to learn it’s usage. While the other is useful if you don’t want to be bugged down by “not so useful details for you”. Get it done in limited specific way and move ahead. People tend to like other one. Windows OS is a proof. Linux gives you flexibilities way beyond you want to use. A generalised implementation. Windows is easy to use. Successful is the one who can manage a balanced way through both.

<p><h3>Abstraction in programming</h3>The real feel of abstraction comes when you start thinking about recursive leap of faith. "Recursive leap of faith" is an ideology that we use while writing a recursive program, in which we just assume that our program will generate right results if we have a valid base case and we are making our main problem smaller towards the base case in recursive call. We dont try to understand the whole execution. Abstract point of view is essential in solving recursive problems. Generally we are confident about what we can see and understand. But this is always based on beliefs on abstract aspects.</p>

<p><h3>Reductionism and holism</h3> Reductionalism is that "whole" of thing can be understood by understanding it’s parts. In holism "whole" is often greater than just sum of its parts. Reductionism is enemy of understanding recursion. Extracting the general aspects of a problem so that you are no more bugged down by the details specific to the domain or implementation is another point to look on the concept of abstraction.</p>
